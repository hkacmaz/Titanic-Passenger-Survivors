# Titanic-Passenger-Survivors

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this complete analysis, Ia am going to analys the people, who were likely to survive or not.

All good data analysis projects begin with trying to answer questions. 

 So here's a list of questions which will be tried to answered

1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)
2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
3.) Where did the passengers come from?
4.) Who was alone and who was with family?

Then dig deeper, with a broader question:

5.) What factors helped someone survive the sinking?
